DESCRIPTION:
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"*/


function DNAStrand(dna){
  let letters = {'A': 'T', 'T': 'A', 'C': 'G', 'G': 'C'};
    let arr = [];
    for (let i=0; i < dna.length; i++) {
        arr[i] = letters[dna[i]];
    }
    return arr.join('');
}
